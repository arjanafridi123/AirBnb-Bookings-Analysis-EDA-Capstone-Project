# AirBnb-Bookings-Analysis-EDA-Capstone-Project

This project aims to analyze Airbnb listings across New York City for the year 2019 to uncover insights into pricing, availability, and listing trends. The dataset includes detailed information such as room types, listing prices, geographic locations, host activity, and customer reviews. By exploring these features, the analysis provides valuable insights into the Airbnb market dynamics in NYC. The findings help support better business decisions, improve host strategies, and enhance the overall experience for guests on the platform.

Understand the distribution of listings across boroughs and neighborhoods. Identify pricing patterns based on location, room type, and availability. Test assumptions about what influences listing price and popularity.
